# BIG-LEGUME
This project is above all a test for me to have a better understanding of how to use github and Godot.
I'm not a dev at all, I know how little I know and I will just try to improve in this project.

To be honest there is not really any logic in this project, MoutonDemocrate, a friend of mine, will help me through my learning and I will be there, with my imagination, creating stupid idea for this game.

The game ! At this moment the plot is that a phantom cat has been kidnapped by a gang of Vegetables know as Big Legume, a lobby that exist to push people to eat more vegetables so the ghost vegetables could be more powerfull. The player is a little ghost that want is cat back so he go beat the ass of the vegetables. The story will involve things as satire of extremist vegan people and extremist carniste people such as joke on wokism and far-right. 
I know it's weird, so you know I'm also a woke, I claim this word as my ideology, and I won't go in details now, so just for you to understand: fuck facism, fuck Israel government and fuck Elon Musk. 

To go back to the game, for now it's not sure about what it'll be precisely, atm it's a action-platformer with three levels.
I hope you will enjoy the game

PS: If at any point in the dev you feel the urge to help, don't hesitate ! The project will be free to use and modify.

> Note from the MoutonDemocrate in question : i thinbk dumb political humor is funi :)
